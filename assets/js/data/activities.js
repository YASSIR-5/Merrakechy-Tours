        <p>After rinsing, you will receive a purifying clay mask treatment using ghassoul, a natural mineral clay from the Atlas Mountains. This is followed by a moisturizing process using pure argan oil, known for its nourishing properties.</p>
        
        <p>The experience concludes with a 30-minute relaxing massage using aromatic oils, leaving you in a state of complete relaxation. Throughout the process, you will be treated with the utmost respect for your privacy and comfort.</p>

        <h3>Experience Overview</h3>
        <p>Experience the cultural treasures of Marrakech on a 3 to 4-hour guided tour. Begin with the Ramparts of Marrakech, a striking 19 km-long wall encircling the old city, featuring 22 historic gates and standing up to 8 meters tall. These walls, made from the regionâ€™s signature red earth, reflect the city's deep-rooted history and architectural charm.

Next, explore the stunning Majorelle Garden, a botanical haven home to nearly 3,000 plant species, created in 1931 by French painter Jacques Majorelle. The garden, inspired by Islamic and Moorish designs, became world-famous thanks to fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent, who restored it in 1980. Its iconic Majorelle Blueâ€”a vivid, soothing color found throughout the propertyâ€”is a registered trademark and a highlight of the visit.

Inside the garden lies the Berber Museum, showcasing a rich collection of traditional Berber artifacts from across Morocco, enhanced by educational materials in French, English, and Arabic..</p>
